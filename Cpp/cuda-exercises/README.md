# CUDA Training Series Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to the problems provided in the [OLCF CUDA Training Series](https://github.com/olcf/cuda-training-series) repository. Each problem focuses on enhancing understanding and proficiency with CUDA programming, covering a range of parallel computing concepts and techniques.

The OLCF CUDA Training Series offers a set of exercises that progressively build up CUDA skills, from basic concepts to more advanced optimization techniques. I have implemented solutions for these exercises independently, without referencing the official solutions, to strengthen my understanding of CUDA programming. 

### Structure
The exercises are organized into homework sets, each containing multiple questions:
* Homework Sets: Each set (e.g., hw1, hw2) includes several questions that build on key CUDA concepts.
* Question-Specific Explanation in ReadMes: Each set includes a README file providing an overview of the questions contained, detailing my approach and key implementation decisions.
* Extensive Code Comments: Each solution is documented with thorough comments, explaining the basic functunalities and CUDA kernel implementations, insights, and more to help guide readers through the code logic.
